Cap white or cream colored, may have fine scales, first hemispherical in shape before flattening out with maturity. Flesh is white, firm and thick. Gills are at first white, becoming pink, then chocolate brown or blackish, free and crowded. Stem is white or cream; it is slightly club-shaped and smooth or finely scaly below the ring. Ring is white or cream, pendulous and superior. Viewed from below, on a closed-cap specimen, it has a well-developed 'cogwheel' pattern around the stem. 

Similar species There are several similar species. Agaricus macrosporus are very fleshy, with scaly stem girdles. Agaricus sylvicola is a woodland variety. Agaricus augustus and Agaricus xanthoderma are also similar. Be careful not to confuse it with the deadly poisonous Amanita virosa, which has white gills.

Fruiting body Covered with short spines and warts, the body falls away pallid buff becoming dull brown. When mature, the outer skin breaks open and brown spores are dispersed by wind and rain. When young and firm, the fruit-bodies are fairly tasteless yet edible. Stem slightly tapering in at the base; spongy; surface soon becoming wrinkled; initially white with pointed warts, but later turning ochre and becoming smooth and leathery.
